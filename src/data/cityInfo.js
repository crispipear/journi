Once you’re out for the day, don’t leave your purse or wallet sitting around—keep them on you, zipped closed, in your pockets, etc.If you're riding a bike, make sure you have a good lock and know how to use it. While random property crime does happen, often simple common sense rules can keep your car and other property safe."

        content: "Seattle does have plenty of homeless people and panhandlers, but most of them are not dangerous and will leave you alone. If someone does approach you for money, it’s okay to decline. If someone hassles you for money or gets aggressive, this is illegal so you can report them to the police either by calling the Seattle Police non-emergency number at 206-625-5011."
